# Mechatronic Engineering Department - University of Nigeria, Nsukka

The Mechatronic Engineering program is designed to train the minds of potential engineers in multidisciplinary design thinking. Our focus is to enable students to harness the coordinated and concurrent synergy between mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and intelligent computer control. By integrating expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation, our graduates are well-equipped to meet the demands of today’s and tomorrow’s industry and service sector.

With a strong emphasis on practical application, our program aims to develop engineers who can design, develop, and manufacture mechatronic products and systems, including robotic and intelligent systems. Students will gain the skills to install, operate, troubleshoot, and manage these systems effectively. Additionally, we foster an entrepreneurial spirit, empowering graduates to create job opportunities in the areas of mechatronics, robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence.

Collaboration is a key aspect of our program, and students will learn to function effectively in multidisciplinary engineering teams and projects. We also prioritize communication skills, ensuring students are proficient in both verbal and written communication, using the latest techniques and tools of Mechatronics.

Join us in the Mechatronic Engineering program and embark on a journey of comprehensive education, hands-on experience, and the opportunity to shape the future of engineering.
